What are CXO positions in a startup?
In the world of startups the term “CXO” refers to all the people who are head of their functional area and members of the executive team, whether that's finance, sales, marketing, HR, or any other function


Chief Experience Officer (CXO), Chief Customer Officer (CCO), or Chief Customer Experience Officer (CCXO) — A C-level executive who represents the needs of customers among the C-suite and who is responsible for setting and executing upon the company's customer and customer experience strategies

As businesses become more analytical and data-driven, CXOs responsible for the growth and health of those businesses need access to data and trends about markets, operations, and other key performance metrics.

Why CXOs Need Data Visualization Dashboards

Unlike airline cockpits, modern Business Intelligence continues to be delivered in formats that require the CXO to be a power user in spreadsheets or a computer scientist! 

In other words, there is a gap between the available data and the decision maker’s area of expertise. This gap is in the way the data is presented. 

A business dashboard solves this problem by presenting the data in an easy to read, visually appealing format. Furthermore, the data visualization and analysis make it universally readable. For instance, a COO may need to track production cost comparisons of various locations and resources, while a CEO may be more interested in ROIs of various initiatives, the overall profitability, etc. Similarly, other CXOs, including CHROs, CFOs, CMOs, CBOs, and CTOs may need to track trends and data related to different parts of the business. 

Improved decision making

Analyzing a large number of event logs in any business requires mechanic intervention. Data analytics platforms can help in forming informed decisions by providing them with access to real-time data.
